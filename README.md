This repository contains an implimentaion of Fibonacci Heap written in Java, and a program written in C that accepts an input matrix and computes the eigenvector with the greatest absoulute eigenvalue of the given matrix via power iteration.

The Fibonacci Heap implimentaion was executed by me and Ido Gazit.

The Power Iteration program was executed by me and Lital Mandelbaum.
